The dataset available to CBC management contains data on movies broadcast on TV in 1992 by the three major U.S. television networks: ABN, BBS, and CBC.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze how and how much a movie's attributes affect its rating. Understanding which attributes weigh most heavily on the success or flop of a television representation is important for deciding programming, evaluating the purchase of a film, and studying the behavior of competitors. Therefore, from the information obtained from this analysis, it will be possible to extract value for all stakeholders.

The ratings taken into consideration are the [Nielsen ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings): the ratio between the number of televisions connected to a given channel on the number of total households that have a television. In 1992, each rating point represented 921,000 American households, so the base was about 92.1 million households.
